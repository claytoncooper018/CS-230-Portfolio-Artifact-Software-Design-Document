Journal Reflection for Module Eight

The finished software design document made for the customer The Gaming Room is contained in this repository. This artifact shows my capacity to assess customer needs, create scalable software, and effectively explain technical choices to development team members and stakeholders.

Give a brief overview of the software requirements for The Gaming Room client.

The customer for this project was The Gaming Room. Their goal was to transform their current game, Draw It or Lose It, from a single-platform program into a distributed, web-based system that could accommodate numerous teams and players on various devices. Scalability, security, and the ability to manage distinct game instances, teams, and players while guaranteeing consistent performance across platforms were all requirements for the program.

What aspects of creating this documentation did you excel at?

I excelled at describing the system architecture in detail and assessing various operating systems. I successfully contrasted memory management techniques, security factors, and deployment possibilities, which supported the ultimate design choices. Both technical and non-technical readers could easily understand the material because it was presented in an organized and expert manner.

When creating the code, what aspects of going through a design document did you find useful?

I was better able to consider the application before developing code after going through the design paper. The implementation process was more structured and less uncertain when requirements, limitations, and system components were predetermined. This method made sure the code was in line with the client's requirements from the beginning and helped avoid design errors.

What aspect of your work on these documents would you chose to edit if you could? How would you make it better?

The section on scalability and performance testing would be expanded if I could make one revision to the document. I would incorporate more thorough methods for managing heavy traffic volumes and tracking system performance over time. By further preparing the design for practical use, this would reinforce it.

How did you understand user demands and incorporate them into the design of your software?

By emphasizing accessibility, dependability, and gameplay fairness, I was able to discern the needs of the user. These requirements were met by design decisions like centralized data administration, a web-based architecture for cross-platform access, and distinct IDs for players and games. Regardless of technological excellence, software that does not meet user expectations frequently fails, so taking user demands into account is essential.

How did you go about creating software, and what methods would you employ going forward?

I tackled software design by dissecting the issue into smaller parts, examining requirements, and weighing several architectural options before deciding which was best. I would keep designing comparable applications in the future by utilizing methods like requirement analysis, UML-style modeling, and iterative review. These tactics aid in guaranteeing maintainability, scalability, and alignment with stakeholder objectives.

My increasing capacity to carefully plan software solutions, clearly describe them, and use software engineering concepts in practical settings is demonstrated by this portfolio product.
